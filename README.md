# College-Management-System-using-java
Building a College Management System using Java and MySQL involves creating the application's backend in Java and using MySQL as the database to store and retrieve data.
#STEPS
1. Set Up MySQL Database:

Install MySQL on your machine or use a hosted MySQL service.
Create a database named college_management_system.
Create tables for students, faculty, courses, attendance, and grades.


2. Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):

Include the MySQL JDBC driver in your project. You can download it from the MySQL website or use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies.
Create a Java class for database connection handling. Use the JDBC API to establish connections, execute queries, and handle results.

3. Create Java Classes:

Create Java classes for Student, Faculty, Course, Attendance, and Grades.
Define class attributes, constructors, getter and setter methods.

4. UI Development:

Use JavaFX or Swing for creating the user interface.
Design screens for adding and updating student and faculty details, managing courses, recording attendance, entering grades, etc.

5. Implement Business Logic:

Implement logic for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for students, faculty, courses, attendance, and grades.
Implement methods to enroll students in courses, calculate attendance percentages, calculate grades, etc.

6. User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement a simple login system for users (admin, teachers, students).
Create roles (admin, teacher, student) and restrict access to different sections based on roles.

7. Error Handling and Validation:

Implement validation checks to ensure data integrity (e.g., unique student IDs, valid email addresses).
Handle database errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

8. Documentation:

Document the code using comments to explain complex sections.
Create user manuals or guides to help users navigate and use the system.
